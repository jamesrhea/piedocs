Hi, I'm James Rhea. I'm a technical writer, documentation engineer, and philosopher who specializes in making difficult concepts easy to understand.

In my day job I write user guides, configuration manuals, API documentation, and other technical documents. In short, I explain complex systems in understandable terms.

Additionally, I have been doing web development since 2002, and have taught university-level courses in logic, philosophy, and ethics.

Common thread: I love to jump into challenging new terrain, wrestle with the content, and produce something useful.

## What is Pie Docs?

Good documentation is a lot like good pie: enjoyable to consume and makes you glad you came across it. This site isn't about cooking, baking, or food. It's about the right information served up to users at the right time and in the right way.
